$aryExplTxt['prog'] = '<p>Each programme of study at the University of Bradford is made up of a number of modules, taken at different stages of
the programme. Modules are available in multiples of ten credits. Each 10-credit module requires the average student to
undertake approximately 100 hours of study, including contact time. This means that a full-time undergraduate student
will study for about 1200 hours in an academic year, spread over 30 weeks {2 semesters]; a postgraduate will study for
an additional E-00 hours in a third trimester, usually on a project.</p><br />
<p>Each module has a designated level, which reﬂects how advanced the material is. Usually, the level is the same as the stage number {the year) in which the module is taken.</p><br />
<p>For each award, some modules are compulsory and some optional. Students may take some elective modules, which may not be related directly to their award but which address an area that is of interest to them {such as studying a language).</p><br />
<p>The curriculum for each programme of study is described in a programme speciﬁcation, which designates the title, credit value, level, stage and semester of each module, and whether it is compulsory or optional.</p><br />';
$aryExplTxt['assmnt'] = "<p>A student is permitted two attempts at each module, the initial one and one supplementary assessment, as of right. A
third attempts will be granted if a student achieves 80 credits at 40% and has undertaken the second attempt. One further attempt (total of 4, including the initial attempt) is at the discretion of the Board of Examiners according to their School algorithm for fourth attempts. The best mark is used to determine the amount of credit achieved and whether a student
meets the progression criteria. Following supplementary assessment, a capped mark of 40% (or the original mark if higher} is used to calculate degree classiﬁcations and eligibility for an award with merit or distinction, where appropriate. If an assessment is not taken at the first attempt, without good cause, or is handed in late, a mark of zero is awarded (which is used in the calculations for classiﬁcation}. If a mark is not achieved, at the ﬁrst attempt, a numbered subscript shows the bona tide attempt number next to the mark on the transcript.</p><br />
<p>Postgraduate awards in the School of Management use a grading system rather than numeric marking. Module results are graded as follows:</p><br />
AD - Pass with distinction<br />
B - Pass with merit<br />
C - Pass<br />
D - Marginal fail<br />
EF - Fail<br />
Awards are made as follows:<br /><br />
Master's degree: at least 160 credits at C or above.<br /><br />
Postgraduate Diploma: at least 100 credits at C or above.<br /><br />
Postgraduate Certificate: at least 40 credits at C or above.";
$aryExplTxt['awards'] = "<p>Once a student has completed a specified number of credits, slhe is entitled to an award of the University (see
Ordinance 2 at http://www.bradford.ac.uk/aqpo/ordinances-and-regulationsl/).</p>
<p>Many of our awards are accredited by professional, statutory and regulatory bodies, which often have requirements
additional to the general regulations of the University applied to programmes of study (such as students having to
pass both the theory and practice components of a module's assessment. or having to pass a particular module with a
minimum overall mark}. Where there are such exceptions, these are referred to in the programme specification. Such
awards may also restrict the number of electives that can be taken.</p>";
